	description `The Mackerel is a fairly unremarkable mid-range transport vessel, decently mobile and with adequate passenger space. What sets apart the Mackerel, and the reason it is such a popular and well-known ship among the Naltok, is its history.`
	description `In the early days of the war, many Naltok civilians on both sides found themselves stranded on the wrong side of the frontline or separated from their friends and family. Merchant captains saw the opportunity this presented and, with implicit approval from both of the warring governments, rallied a fleet of Mackerel transport vessels to ferry citizens to their desired side of the boundary.`

A popular joke among the Naltok is that all their ships are named for fish, but only the Flounder flies like one. The handling of the Flounder is so legendarily bad that the latest model has been designed to carry two Minnow drones, because waiting for the drones to ferry cargo up and down through the atmosphere is generally agreed to be a preferable alternative to attempting to land the Flounder in a spaceport.`

	description `Several designs were proposed, but ultimately the Xochira opted to begin constructing the Archerfish; a low-cost, high-speed light warship carrying two Leech-Rays. To date, the Xochira maintain that no Alpha warship has ever escaped the Archerfish long enough to escape to Telashki space.`

	description `The Mola is a heavy carrier designed by the Telashki. Though underarmed for its size, the Mola's strength lies in its large complement of Remora fighters. Fully stocked, the Mola can in theory bring more than fifty weapons to bear against a target, enough to overwhelm almost any opponent.`

	description `The original design for the Coelacanth predates the war by a few centuries, having initially been a proposal for a city-ship to house Naltok populations in the event that their planets became too crowded. After many rounds of adjustments and updates, focusing particularly on militarisation, this colossal warship is the result.`

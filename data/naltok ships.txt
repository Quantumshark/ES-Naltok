	description `In the early days of the war, many Naltok civilians on both sides found themselves stranded on the wrong side of the frontline or separated from their friends and family. Merchant captains saw the opportunity this presented and, with implicit approval from both of the warring governments, rallied a fleet of Mackerel transport vessels to ferry citizens to their desired side of the boundary.`

	description `The original design for the Coelacanth predates the war by a few centuries, having initially been a proposal for a city-ship to house Naltok populations in the event that their planets became too crowded. After many rounds of adjustments and updates, focusing particularly on militarisation, this colossal warship is the result.`

	description `Inspired by the Telashki Remora, the Lamprey is the Xochira take on a small, fast carried ship. Extending the concept behind the Archerfish, the Lamprey's defining features are its excellent top speed and its armament consisting entirely of a single Leech-Ray.`

	description `This tiny drone, typically used for mining, mounts the bare minimum hardware required to power two Breaker cannons and a tiny set of engines. To make further savings on space, the Minnow has a built-in battery, rather than expanding it to fit the rather bulky batteries used in larger Naltok ships.`

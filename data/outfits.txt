	description "The Naltok prefer not to use fusion reactors on their ships, opting instead for these highly efficient fission reactors. While the resulting generators are less powerful than human fusion technology, they produce vastly less heat."

	description "This enormous fission reactor produces less heat than a human equivalent less than half its size, which more than makes up for its somewhat lacking power output."

	description "Because shields are not their ships' primary form of protection, the Naltok have focused on making their generators more energy-efficient rather than more powerful. As a result, this generator is not much more powerful than its human equivalent, but uses only a fraction of the energy while generating."

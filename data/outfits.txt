	description "The Naltok prefer not to use fusion reactors on their ships, opting instead for these highly efficient fission reactors. While the resulting generators are less powerful than human fusion technology, they produce vastly less heat."

	"shield energy" .125
	description "Because shields are not their ships' primary form of protection, the Naltok have focused on making their generators more energy-efficient rather than more powerful. As a result, this generator is not much more powerful than its human equivalent, but uses only a fraction of the energy while generating."

	description "The larger shield generators produced by humanity are slightly more powerful than this shield generator, despite millenia of Naltok technological advances. However, no human shield generator even approaches this device's energy efficiency."

	description "For a long time, the Naltok have employed genetically engineered bacteria as a means of separating out the deuterium required for hyperspace travel from hydrogen supplies. With the advent of the Xochira's fearsome Drainer, the Telashki have begun producing this ship-borne equivalent, which is able to continually supply a ship with small amounts of hyperspace fuel."

	description "Naltok batteries are bulky and not particularly effective. The best that can be said about them is that the Naltok, evidently realising this, make them available at a very low price."

	description `This is Kachathi's greatest creation, a device that allows the ship carrying it to dissapear completely from all sensors - optical, infrared and radar detection will all observe nothing more than an empty region of space.`
	description `Few, if any, ships (and certainly none built by the Naltok) can support its energy requirements for any length of time, but the Telashki have nonetheless been taking advantage of these devices to sneak their Alpha allies past the Xochira.`

	"flare sound" "ion small"
	description "The lead engineer who designed the latest model of these thrusters spent months searching for new ways to reduce their power consumption and minimise the loss of energy as heat. According to a popular story, she was only satisfied when the engines were no hotter to the touch during a test run than the stone floor of the warehouse they were being stored in."

	"flare sound" "ion medium"
	description "Even the Quarg look at Naltok engines with a begrudging admiration for their spectacular efficiency, and the underwhelming thrust of those same engines gives them plenty of time to do so."

	"flare sprite" "effect/ion flare/large"
		"frame rate" 0.9
	"flare sound" "ion large"
	description "At their core Naltok engines are ion engines not unlike those produced by the Syndicate. What sets Naltok thrusters apart is the work generations of engineers have put into minimising their power requirements by any means available to them, which has resulted in efficiency unmatched almost anywhere in the galaxy."

	"flare sprite" "effect/ion flare/huge"
		"frame rate" 0.8
	"flare sound" "ion huge"
	description "Compared to the largest human thrusters, the Monitor is relatively small, but it nonetheless provides a reasonable amount of thrust. Where the Monitor shines is its efficiency, which massively eclipses any comparable human technology."

	"steering flare sprite" "effect/ion flare/tiny"
		"frame rate" 1.2
	"steering flare sound" "ion tiny"
	description "This tiny steering system sees frequent use on the smallest Naltok ships, but it is also used by pilots attempting to cram just a little bit more steering power onto their ship. Unlike a comparable plasma or atomic engine one might encounter in human space, the addition of this Naltok steering system will almost never require additional power or cooling to compensate."

	"steering flare sprite" "effect/ion flare/small"
		"frame rate" 1.1
	"steering flare sound" "ion small"
	description "Unlike most, the Naltok typically build their steering systems larger than the corresponding thrusters. There are probably many reasons for this, but a notable one is their apparent refusal to use reverse thrusters."

	"steering flare sprite" "effect/ion flare/medium"
		"frame rate" 1.0
	"steering flare sound" "ion medium"
	description "The Naltok pride themselves on the efficiency of their technology. Whereas a human engineer might try to improve the force offered by this steering system, or perhaps seek to make it smaller, the Naltok have instead focused on trying to allow it to run on as little energy as possible."

	"turning heat" 1.8
	"steering flare sprite" "effect/ion flare/large"
		"frame rate" 0.9
	"steering flare sound" "ion large"
	description "A steering system this large would probably only see use on the largest ships in human space, but the Naltok will often cram it onto substantially smaller ships, even if that means sacrificing some top speed. The fact that only a relatively small generator and typically no cooling systems at all are required to operate it is perhaps as much of a factor in this as the unexplained Naltok fondness for tight cornering on their vessels."

		"frame rate" 0.8
	"steering flare sound" "ion huge"
	description "There are few, if any, steering systems in the galaxy that are larger than this colossal set. Nevertheless, it still produces less heat than an ion engine half its size, a testament to the spectacular efficiency of Naltok technology."

	description "Unlike most others, the Telashki apparently have no qualms with using biological weapons in close combat, though they usually find their own augmentations sufficient. Fortunately, rather than employing bioengineered pathogens, they appear to prefer weapons like this - a medium-sized synthetic organism which can be easily carried and which spews a spray of deadly acid if disturbed."
	description "While laws regulating the use of biological weapons were not written with this in mind, most governments will cite the excessive suffering of the victims as reason enough why Acid Grubs should be illegal. As such, you are likely to be the victim of a heavy fine if you are caught with it outside Telashki space."

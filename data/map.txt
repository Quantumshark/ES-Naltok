	description "The environmental conditions on this planet make it almost the perfect home for the Naltok - the first explorers to land here described the conditions as more homely than their homeworld."
	description "Unfortunately, those same conditions also make Chireke the perfect home for a wide range of incredibly fast-growing plant species, many of which can grow through metres of solid concrete with the same ease with which most plants would grow through a few centimetres of soil. Every attempt to establish major settlements here has been reduced to rubble and reclaimed by the jungle within a few months."
	spaceport "The spaceport sits atop a high mountain plateau, where the cold, dry conditions and thin air inhibit plant growth enough that permanent structures can be established. The unique flora of this planet have given rise to a fairly large lumber industry, and the railway from the mountaintop to the jungle below has become a fairly large tourist attraction as well."

	description "Joklanok is home to several landmasses with ideal conditions to support large cities. It is also home to a colossal desert continent which spans most of the equator, and which frequently fills the atmosphere with catastrophic and unpredictable sandstorms which can often reach all the way to the poles."
	description "To combat the wear from the sandstorms the Naltok built enormous, sloped buildings from the same mineralising bacterial communities used in their ships. In addition to resisting the sandstorms, the largest city here also famously survived an asteroid impact - after evacuating the whole city, the residents were surprised to see that within a few weeks the buildings had recovered completely."
	spaceport `The primary spaceport here was originally a temporary port built to facilitate evacuation in preparation for the asteroid strike. Having been both larger and more streamlined than the original port, the "Evacuation Port" was expanded and refurbished by the Ministry of Transport and is now widely considered to be the most pleasant spaceport anywhere in Naltok space.

	description "Based on its position, this tiny moon should be no more than an uninhabitable ball of ice and rock. Instead, its surface is warmed to only a few degrees below freezing by the decay of the abnormally high portion of radioisotopes present in its crust."
	description "As such, while the lack of sunlight makes Kevoshek unsuited for large-scale colonisation, it is home to massive automatic mining facilities harvesting material for use in the Naltok reactors and radioisotopic generators."
	spaceport "The spaceport here, like the mining operations, is entirely automatic - the radiation makes long-term habitation unsafe. Mechanical attendants and computer terminals greet you and the Naltok freight captains looking for well-paid transport jobs to other planets."

planet Kolxacha

	description "This planet serves as the defensive line of the Telashki. Its proximity to their major industrial worlds is both a blessing and a curse - while it is easy to keep the fleets here supplied, those planets would be under direct attack if the defenses here ever failed. It is for this reason, rather than any other, that this minimally habitable planet has become such a bustling centre of activity."
	spaceport "The sheer number of warships here is disturbing. While this part of the spaceport is primarily for incoming shipments of materials, you were able to see the enormous defensive fleet stationed on this planet as you flew in to land. Enormous numbers of warships are stationed here, all ready to take off and engage an enemy at the first sign of danger."

	description "This Quarg ringworld is roughly half complete, the result of more than five millenia of work. Construction here began at around the same time as work began on the Great Pyramids of Egypt back on Earth, and continued throughout the rise and fall of Babylon, Greece, Rome and countless other human civilisations - a testament to the stability and persistence of the Quarg and their society."
	description "Other than the extension of the backbone of the ring, it appears that much of the work being carried out here is centred around establishing hydroponic farms and the other infrastructure required to allow the ring to support permanent habitation."
	spaceport "The spaceport is bustling with activity, but almost all of it is directly connected to the construction work here. Whole areas are almost unused, but still staffed, while passing through a single door or even walking across a room often leaves you in the middle of a dense crowd of Quarg, many of them Skylark crew and captains looking for their next cargo assignment."
	spaceport "The few Naltok who have decided to spend some time here despite the absence of the pools of water favoured in their own buildings greet you as you pass through, but neither you nor they are inclined to stay for longer than you have to."

The location close to the Quarg ringworld allows the Ministry to easily monitor Quarg activity in the neighboring system, though the original intent was to facilitate interspecies cooperation."
	spaceport "Large parts of the spaceport are designed to mimic Quarg architecture, with high ceilings and smooth, meticulously cleaned panels. There is ongoing work on creating a section inspired by human architecture, although the sections that have been completed so far feel distinctly uncanny."

Carefully planned terraforming operations have transformed much of the land into idyllic (by Naltok standards) swamps and marshes, and the Ministry building with its immediately recognisable double helix motif is visible for hundreds of miles across the flat and mostly empty land."

Unfortunately, none of those landmasses exists for more than a few hours at a time. The enormous tides here reveal and submerge vast tracts of land several times a day, making the planet unsuitable for long-term habitation, either in traditional cities or large vessels."

	spaceport `The spaceport here, like many Naltok buildings, is filled with about a foot of lukewarm water. For the Naltok this is essential, in order to prevent their skin from drying out in the air, but for humans and any other visitors this is inconvenient and highly unpleasant. Unlike many other Naltok buildings however, this building has "Visitor paths" which are almost entirely dry, allowing humans and alphas to traverse most of the spaceport in comfort.`

Although the gravity here is lower than on their homeworld, conditions are otherwise fairly close to ideal for the Naltok. Motivated in part by how close they had come to extinction on their home planet, the Naltok sent a generation ship to this system long before they discovered the hyperdrive, and the society here was separated from the rest of their species for nearly two hundred years."
	description "The population here welcomed the arrival of the first hyperspace-capable vessels here with open arms, and quickly integrated into the interstellar Naltok society, but there are still some cultural differences between here and the rest of their space."
	spaceport "The spaceport is in the centre of the largest and oldest city on this planet, and there is a viewing gallery that overlooks the generation ship that originally brought the first Naltok settlers here.

	description "This changed, however, when the Humans and Alphas arriving in Naltok space saw Xutajol as a perfect spot to settle down, and the planet now boasts a population of nearly a thousand non-Naltok residents. With the outbreak of the current civil war, Xutajol's distance from the frontline with the Xochira became another boon for the battle-weary crews of the Alpha ships."

Following the signposts along the canals would take you to the recently expanded old Naltok spaceport, with the excess moisture they favour in their dwellings.

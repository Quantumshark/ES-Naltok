	description "The Naltok prefer not to use fusion reactors on their ships, opting instead for these highly efficient fission reactors. While the resulting generators are less powerful than human fusion technology, they produce vastly less heat."

	description "Because shields are not their ships' primary form of protection, the Naltok have focused on making their generators more energy-efficient rather than more powerful. As a result, this generator is not much more powerful than its human equivalent, but uses only a fraction of the energy while generating."

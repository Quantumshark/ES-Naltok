			"It amazes me that Humans and Naltok share the same amino acids, DNA bases and translational apparatus! It's a shame we've never managed to get a DNA sample from a Quarg."
			"Have you seen the Star-Worms of Norelon? They're beautiful to watch, but they can be a real headache if they get onto a planet with the right surface conditions."
			"I wonder if there's alien life out there? Besides you, obviously. And the Quarg. And the Alphas. And the Star-Worms, I suppose. Okay, now I think about it there's probably quite a lot."
			"I wish the Quarg were more cooperative. They clearly know so much that we don't, but they've never been willing to share."

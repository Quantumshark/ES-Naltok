A popular joke among the Naltok is that all their ships are named for fish, but only the Flounder flies like one. The handling of the Flounder is so legendarily bad that the latest model has been designed to carry two Minnow drones, because waiting for the drones to ferry cargo up and down through the atmosphere is generally agreed to be a preferable alternative to attempting to land the Flounder in a spaceport.`

	description `Several designs were proposed, but ultimately the Xochira opted to begin constructing the Archerfish; a low-cost, high-speed light warship carrying two Drainers. To date, the Xochira maintain that no Alpha warship has ever escaped the Archerfish long enough to escape to Telashki space.`

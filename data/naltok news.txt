			"It amazes me that Humans and Naltok share the same amino acids, DNA bases and translational apparatus! It's a shame we've never managed to get a DNA sample from a Quarg."
			"Have you seen the Star-Worms of Norelon? They're beautiful to watch, but they can be a real headache if they get onto a planet with the right surface conditions."
			"I wonder if there's alien life out there? Besides you, obviously. And the Quarg. And the Alphas. And the Star-Worms, I suppose. Okay, now I think about it there's probably quite a lot."
			"I wish the Quarg were more cooperative. They clearly know so much that we don't, but they've never been willing to share."
			"My transgenic bacterial samples grew 233% more rapidly on average than the control group! That's an improvement of 0.43% over the last batch!"
			"Would you be willing to bring me some soil samples from your homeworld? I'm studying the connections between soil microbiomes and physiological features of sentient species."
			"The bacteria in Naltok starship hulls actually combine enzymes isolated from species from four different planets, as well as many totally artificial designs."
			"Metallurgy? It's an interesting subject, but quite dated. If you ask me, the major advances of this milennium will be in xenobiology."

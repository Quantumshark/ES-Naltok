			`This planet is populated by a species of aliens that remind you of giant newts, slightly shorter than you and with large eyes and dark, rubbery skin. They move languidly through the spaceport, which appears to be flooded with around a foot of water, and several of them come in to watch your ship as you land.`
			`	Several of them have gathered in a crowd outside your ship's door, waiting for you to leave. You notice that two of them, standing near the back of the crowd, are substantially larger than the others and posess an additional pair of arms.
			`	As you cautiously open your ship's hatch, the crowd of aliens opens slightly. An individual wearing a tight, dark green outfit made from some kind of plastic-like material steps forward, pauses briefly, then begins speaking to you.`

			`As you blast open the airlock of the mysterious ship that had been attacking you, you find yourself face to face with an alien and knee-deep in water. The alien resembles a giant newt, with dark, rubbery skin and large eyes, and is slightly shorter than you. The water is lukewarm, and quickly washes over your lower legs.`
			`	The alien immediately reaches down to its waist, where you see two pistols holstered.`

			`	You and the alien continue holding each other at gunpoint for nearly a minute. The air on the ship is excessively damp, and you realise that neither you nor the alien have blinked.`

			`	Suddenly, a light on the ceiling begins to flash in a piercing green colour, and a loud unpleasant sound begins playing from a small device on the ceiling.`
			`	The alien stands motionless for a couple of seconds, then drops its weapons, raises its hands and slowly steps towards you.`

			`As soon as it is on your ship, the alien takes some kind of device from its pocket and begins speaking into it quickly. After a few moments, your sensors inform you that the other ships in the system have apparently stopped attacking you.`
			`	The alien walks over to your starmap and points at itself, then at a particular nearby system. It seems as though it wishes to be taken there.`
